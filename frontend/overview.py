    Rainfall plays a crucial role in India's agriculture, economy, and overall ecosystem. 
    Understanding rainfall patterns helps in disaster management, water resource allocation, 
    and planning agricultural activities. This overview presents insights into rainfall trends 
    and statistics across different states in India.

    # Contributing Factors Section
    st.markdown("""
    ### Contributing Factors to Rainfall Patterns in India
    - **Monsoon Seasons**: The Indian monsoon is a vital component of the annual rainfall cycle, 
      bringing heavy rains to most parts of the country between June and September.
    - **Geographical Influences**: The topography of India, including the Western Ghats and Himalayas, 
      significantly influences rainfall patterns, leading to varying amounts of rainfall across regions.
    - **Climate Change**: Increasing temperatures and changing weather patterns are affecting rainfall 
      distribution and intensity, leading to more extreme weather events.
